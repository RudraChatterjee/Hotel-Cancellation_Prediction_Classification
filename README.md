# Hotel-Cancellation_Prediction_Supervised-Learning_Classification
## Summary
<p style='text-align: justify;'> A chain of hotels is having issues with booking cancellations leading to loss of revenue. This notebook explores customer booking data to evalaute which factors have a strong influence on booking cancellations. Classification models based on logistic regression and decision trees are developed to predict which bookings will be cancelled in advance. A confusion matrix is constructed to evaluate which performance metric (precision, recall and/or f1 score) needs to be prioritized in the ML prediction model. Threshold for the Logistic Regression models are optimized using AUC-ROC curve and the precision-recall curve. Decision Tree models are improved using grid search for hyperparameter tuning and pruning techniques particularly cost-complexity pruning. A Final ML model is selected that generalizes well and provides a decent balance between the different performance metrics. Business recommendations are provided based on the insights from EDA and ML solutions that can help formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds for the hotel chain.</p>
